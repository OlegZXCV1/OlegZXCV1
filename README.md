🔭 I’m currently working on:
Improving automation frameworks for large-scale enterprise systems, expanding E2E test coverage, and optimizing CI/CD-based quality gates.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
Advanced Playwright features, containerized test environments (Testcontainers), and modern approaches to shift-left quality engineering.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
Open-source test automation tools, performance testing solutions, or any projects focused on scalable QA automation frameworks.

🤔 I’m looking for help with:
Exploring cutting-edge AI-assisted testing techniques and integrating ML-based quality insights into automated pipelines.

💬 Ask me about:
Java automation, Selenide/Selenium/Playwright, API testing with Rest-Assured, performance testing (Gatling/JMeter), CI/CD integration, testing best practices, and QA team leadership.
